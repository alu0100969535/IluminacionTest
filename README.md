# Technical details

## Environments

### Interior

The interior environment meshes are taken from this Epic resource, [Edith Finch: Edie Room
](https://unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/ef-edie), which has the models ready to use and a lot of props to play with. 

The room was constructed directly using the provided walls and later on it was added the doors, doorframes, windows and a curtain to cover one window. After that some other props where placed in the room to make a interesting place to see all the ilumination effects.

### Exterior

The exterior environment was hand made using the landscape tools in UnrealEngine. It is a default sized landscape that has some mountains to limit the visibility of the paths and intersections. There is a range of mountains placed right in the edge of the map to avoid the player getting into the limits.

#### Landscape materials

For the landscape a special layered material was created using three base materials: ForestSoil, Moss and Snow.

These three materials were downloaded from [Quixel Megascans](https://quixel.com/megascans/home/)
